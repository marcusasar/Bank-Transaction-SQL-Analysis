## Overview

This project analyzes bank transaction data to:
- Identify patterns in fraudulent activities.
- Investigate transaction trends (by type, volume, and amount).
- Analyze the relationship between latency and transaction outcomes.

## Data

The dataset used for analysis contains details of transactions including:
- **Transaction Amount**
- **Transaction Date & Time**
- **Transaction Status** (successful, failed, etc.)
- **Device Type** (mobile, desktop)
- **Fraud Flag** (indicating if the transaction is suspected as fraudulent)

The raw data is located in the `/data` folder. The data may be in CSV or Excel format.

## SQL Queries

The core of the analysis is performed through SQL queries. All the SQL scripts used in the analysis are located in the `/sql` folder. These queries are designed to extract meaningful insights from the transaction data.

Here are some examples of the types of SQL queries in this project:
- Analyzing the distribution of fraudulent transactions.
- Identifying trends in transaction volume and amounts over time.
- Measuring transaction latency (in ms) and its impact on transaction success.

## Analysis

The analysis is divided into the following sections:
### Fraud Detection
- Identified patterns in fraudulent transactions.
- Found correlations between fraudulent activities and transaction characteristics (e.g., amount, time, device used).

### Transaction Trends
- Examined trends in transaction volumes, amounts, and types over time.
- Identified peak periods and low-activity periods.

### Latency Analysis
- Measured the time it took to process transactions (latency) and its effect on transaction success rates.
- Analyzed whether higher latency was correlated with failed or fraudulent transactions.

## How to Run the Analysis
